# 👋 Bonjour! I’m Ricardo Martins

**🛠️ Mechanical Engineer** $\rightarrow$ **🔍 Data Science Student**

*(Yes, I'm also learning French… sadly it’s not a programming language yet 🇫🇷🤷‍♂️)*


## 🚀 Who Am I?

I started out solving problems with gears and physics, and now I solve them with data and code.

My engineering background gave me the **math, physics, and systems-thinking** needed to understand the world — but coding gave me something even better: **instant feedback**.

For me, coding is basically a video game:
* If it runs ➜ **🥳 XP gained**
* If it doesn’t ➜ **🧩 Time to solve the puzzle**

I love building things, breaking them, fixing them, and learning along the way.


## 🧪 Some Projects on My Journey

I like seeing how far I've come by looking back at what I've built — here are some highlights:

| Project | Key Focus Areas | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **⭐ Portfolio** | Frontend, Design, Vercel | My personal website where I showcase my work and experiments. Continuously evolving. |
| **💧 Water Prediction Dashboard** | ML, Data Pipelines, Visualization | A dashboard for a water usage prediction model — combining data pipelines, visualization, and ML. |
| **🚲 Community Bike System App** | Databases, Backend Flows | An app made for a local bike-sharing community. Learned a ton about databases and backend flows. |
| **🏍️ University Motorbike Racing Website** | Next.js, Frontend | A full website for a university motorbike racing team — paired nicely with my new love for frontend work. |
| **🧾 Receipt Tracker (My proudest one!)** | **E2E Automation, Cloud, APIs, DB** | Take a photo of a receipt on WhatsApp $\rightarrow$ lands in Google Cloud $\rightarrow$ parsed by OpenAI API $\rightarrow$ saved to a Postgres DB. Super fast, super efficient, and my pockets have never been cleaner. |


## 🏗️ What I’m Building Now

### 🌐 Small Business Websites
Creating websites for small companies using **Next.js**, deployed to **Vercel**, connected to a **Neon cloud PostgreSQL database** via **Prisma**. I’m building my own analytics dashboard to help clients understand their traffic and user behavior.

If it involves building something useful and making data talk — **I’m in.**
